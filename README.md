## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Fully Functional books library website Bibliophile is a responsive book library website. The technologies used in this project are React js. The data is accessed locally using static html template, I am updating to api so that it can be accessed dynamically. I took almost 40 - 50 hrs to complete this project. SkillLync helped me by providing the strutures and technically   for all relevant feature pages.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you the project and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites
This project was create with Create React App.

```
Visual studio code is required.
```

### Installing 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
